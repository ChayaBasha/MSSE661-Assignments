# What is Done
- Login works
- Lgout works
- Display Jounral Entries (showing name and date) works 
- Auth Token does time out
- Auth token does send req header with bearer ${access-token}

# TO DO Still
- Journal Entries should be clickable so that you can go to Jounral Body on new screen and view/edit
- need to get it to only dipaplay that user's jounral entries not all jounral entries
- Need to test pathway to see if it successfuly logs out when token timer is up and no activity 
- Need to create front end for adding new journal entries
